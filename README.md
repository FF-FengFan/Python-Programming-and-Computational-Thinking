### Course Description
Computational thinking is an essential skill for all students, regardless of their business discipline. This course focuses on fundamental principles and concepts for problem formulation and problem-solving beyond just programming. Its goal is to equip students with foundational computational skills, including iteration, abstraction, recursion, and functional decomposition. To support learning, students will be introduced to basic programming constructs such as control statements and data structures. Designed for beginners, this introductory course is ideal for those with little or no prior programming experience.
